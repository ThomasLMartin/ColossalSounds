## Introduction
This was a class project designed to give us hands on experience building out an API, working together as a team, and utilizing GitHub for as our version control software. Instruments were a common connection between the four of us, so we decided to tackle a project that would benefit an owner of a music store. Thinking more along the lines of a mom and pop type store.

Our goal was to provide the owner with a multifunctional application that allowed them have the ability to create and manage a database for their inventory, customers, and transacations.
